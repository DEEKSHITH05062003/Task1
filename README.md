Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a data science technique that helps data scientists analyze data sets and gain insights into their structure, patterns, and relationships. EDA is a vital first step in the data science process and is used to: 
Identify outliers 
Uncover key characteristics of the data 
Understand the distribution of underlying features 
Detect missing values 
Enhance the effectiveness of prediction models 
Make informed decisions about feature selection, transformation, and engineering 
Determine if statistical techniques are appropriate
